JSON.stringify() method is a great way to debug JSON data. Say you retreive a JSON data from somewhere and you want to output the result onto the screen. The following code works like a magic.

```
<pre><code>{JSON.stringify(preload, null, 4)}</code></pre>
```

The second parameter to JSON.stringify() is called a replacer, which can be either a function or an array. Most of the time we just put a `null` as the second parameter, but it does come in handy when we need to filter out properties.

On the other hand, JSON.parse() is used to parse a JSON string, constructing the JavaScript value or object described by the string. 

The second parameter to JSON.parse() is called a receiver function, which can be used to pre-process the data before being returned.
