title: New Blog, New Challenge...

Digitally, I moved from Blogspot to Github. Physically, I moved from China to Australia. I think I have already won a battle the moment I decided to jump out of my comfort zone to pursue what I really want - to be a geek.

There is no doubt that the road ahead as a full stack developer is bumpy, but I would not cringe on my way to be one of the best developers in the world.

Dream big and start today.
