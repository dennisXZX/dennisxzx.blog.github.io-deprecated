NVM is short for Node Version Manager, which helps you manage multiple active Node.js versions.

However, it might be a bit difficult for a beginner to install NPM even though it has a lengthy documentation.

First, you should install NVM using an install script.

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.2/install.sh | bash
```

Then, use __sudo vi ~/.bash_profile__ to check whether the following source line is added. (Just a kind reminder, use __:q!__ to quit vi editor.)

```
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
```

Finally, you need to reactive the .bash_profile by __. ~/.bash_profile__.

Bravo! Now you should be able to execute __nvm --version__.
